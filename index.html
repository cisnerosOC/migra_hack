                                The militarization of the U.S. border with Mexico in the name of national security has fundamentally reshaped the area's physical landscape, creating communities unlike any in this world. Unique cultures blossom in the Borderlands, created by people subject to laws found only in this a x,xxx mile stretch of desert. As the U.S escalates its resources poured into this militarization, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency tasked with enforcing these policies, runs a rogue agency that promotes racial profiling, accrues casualties without consequence, and keeps undocumented immigrants stranded within a 100-mile radius of the border without access to basic human rights.

                                On October 10, 2012, a U.S. Border Patrol agent on the U.S. side of the U.S.-Mexican border shot 16-year old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez 10 times - 8 times in the back - even though Rodriguez was on the Mexican side of the border. Although the agent alleges Rodriguez was throwing rocks at him, witnesses say Rodriguez was just walking along the sidewalk.

                                It took three years after the shooting for the agent to get charged with murder, it being the first time an agent for the U.S. Border Patrol was charged.
