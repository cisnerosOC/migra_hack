                                The militarization of the U.S. border with Mexico in the name of national security has fundamentally reshaped the area's physical landscape, creating communities unlike any in this world. Unique cultures blossom in the Borderlands, created by people subject to laws found only in this 1,989 mile stretch of desert. As the U.S. escalates its resources poured into this militarization, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency tasked with enforcing these policies, runs a rogue police force that promotes racial profiling, accrues casualties without consequence, and keeps undocumented immigrants stranded within a 100-mile radius of the border without access to basic human rights.

Although the agent alleges Rodriguez was throwing rocks at him, witnesses say Rodriguez was just walking along the sidewalk.

While people are suffering, border patrol and corporations are reaping benefits and huge profits. It is unacceptable that very few people have faced consequences for this agency's unregulated actions. It is time to hold them accountable once and for all by advocating for tangible solutions, such as:
